  <p>In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.</p>

  <p>Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <strong> Cash Money.</strong> The Dirty South with <strong>LaFace Records.</strong>The east-coast/west-coast feud is <strong>Bad Boy</strong>vs. <strong>Death Row.</strong> In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.</p>

  <p>We wanted to surgace the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard(collaborating with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Beachum">Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights).
By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at anhy given time, we'd understand who was wielding enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.</p>
